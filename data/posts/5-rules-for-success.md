# 1. Don't put all eggs in one basket

Risk management is everything. I learned this the hard way. Having grown up in a modest household, I became comparatively rich in my mid-twenties only to lose that wealth a few years after. Spreading your risk is vital to avoid ruin. Whether this means spreading your investments or having an exit strategy when it comes to your career, this is core to survival.

# 2. Slow and steady wins the race

Avoid shortcuts and do the hard work required. Delay gratification and long growth. Smart people plan ahead multiple years, some even decades. Realise that the end goal is reached by sustainable growth. Build habits that move you in the direction of where you want to go.

# 3. Stay ethical

Be honest with yourself. Treat others as you would like to be treated. Business partners and customers will sense that you work hard to give them your best. Earn their trust. This will make them feel comfortable coming back to you in the future.

&nbsp;

# 4. One step ahead of the competition

Other people are most likely pursuing the same things as you. Keep an eye on what they are doing. Are they putting in the same work as you? This is a where you can distinguish yourself. Try finding creative solutions to gain an edge or simply put in more work. Stand out of the crowd.

&nbsp;

# 5. Dream big and believe in yourself

Self belief is extremely powerful.
Without confidence, or sometimes even an irrational belief in yourself, you will most likely fail. Unconsciously you will sabotage yourself resulting in you giving up. Most people don't realise what potential lies within them. 
Dare to dream! Work towards achieving your dreams! If find you are struggling you can start with small goals to get the momentum going.
